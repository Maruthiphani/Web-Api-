# Product Data Manipulation API

Welcome to the Product Data Manipulation API repository! This project presents an ASP.NET Core Web API meticulously designed to streamline a diverse range of operations associated with product data management. Leveraging a fusion of Dapper and Entity Framework (EF) Core, the API exemplifies an ingenious blend of efficient and adaptable data access mechanisms.

## Features

- **Dapper**: Harnessing the capabilities of Dapper, a powerful micro ORM, this API ensures the swift retrieval and manipulation of data. Dapper's innate simplicity and unparalleled performance render it an optimal choice for applications that demand rapid and precise data access.

- **Entity Framework Core**: Complementing the data access paradigm, the API employs the prowess of Entity Framework Core. By integrating advanced ORM capabilities, 
    EF Core proffers an extensive suite of abstractions, migration tools for facile database schema management, and LINQ support, enriching the querying experience.

- **Stored Procedures**: In addition to the pivotal ORM-based data interaction, this project seamlessly integrates the utility of stored procedures tailored for specific database operations. 
  The strategic utilization of stored procedures not only yields performance enhancements but also augments security by confining direct table access. 
  This design approach enhances the API's modularity, positioning it as a versatile microservice that can be effortlessly injected into diverse applications, aligning with microservices architecture principles and enabling modular scalability.
